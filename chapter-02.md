# Chapter 2: The Accidents

The Lincoln County Courthouse sat three blocks from Highway 101, a brick building from the 1930s with narrow windows and a copper dome gone green with salt air. Brennan arrived at nine-thirty after a restless night at the Fisherman's Rest listening to foghorns.

Morrison was waiting in the lobby with two paper cups of coffee. He handed her one without preamble. "Dr. Webb's expecting us. Autopsy room is in the basement."

Brennan took the coffee—black, already cooling—and followed him down a stairwell that smelled of disinfectant and mildew. The walls were painted institutional green.

The autopsy room was white tile, stainless steel tables, formaldehyde barely masking something worse. Dr. Martin Webb stood at a desk reviewing typed notes through reading glasses. He was in his sixties, gray hair combed over a balding crown, wearing a rumpled suit.

"Agent Brennan." He shook her hand briefly. "Detective Morrison. I understand you have questions about the Kowalski case."

"I'd like to review your findings."

Webb gestured to a folder. "Preliminary report. Full toxicology will take two weeks, but cause of death is straightforward. Drowning, with contributing blunt force trauma to the posterior cranium."

Brennan opened the folder. The autopsy photos were clinical but brutal. "Tell me about the head trauma."

"Blunt force impact, approximately three inches above the occipital protuberance. Depressed skull fracture, subdural hematoma. Consistent with striking a hard surface—rock, concrete, the cave wall itself."

"Was she conscious after the impact?"

Webb hesitated. "Difficult to say definitively. The fracture was severe but not immediately fatal. She could have been stunned, disoriented. The seawater in her lungs indicates she was alive when she went into the water."

"Or when the tide came in around her," Morrison said quietly.

Brennan studied the photos. "The positioning—did you observe it before the body was moved?"

"I arrived after recovery, but I reviewed the photographs. The position was unusual. Arms extended, reaching toward the wall. But tidal action can move bodies in unexpected ways."

"Can it position them symmetrically? Both arms at the same angle, hands reaching for the same point?"

Webb removed his glasses, cleaning them with a handkerchief. "Agent Brennan, I've been doing this for thirty-two years. I've recovered drowning victims in every conceivable position. The positioning could absolutely be explained by tidal movement."

"Could be," Brennan said. "Or it could be staging."

"Based on what evidence?"

"The carved symbols on the cave wall. The victim's hands were reaching toward deliberate markings cut into the stone."

Webb glanced at Morrison, who remained expressionless. "I saw mention of markings in the scene report. Detective Morrison noted possible historical graffiti."

"The carvings are recent," Brennan said. "And the victim was positioned to interact with them. That's not accident. That's presentation."

"Or coincidence." Webb put his glasses back on. "Agent Brennan, you're building a theory on very thin evidence. A young woman went exploring in a dangerous location, suffered a head injury, and drowned. Tragic, but not mysterious."

Brennan closed the folder. "I'd like to review the autopsy findings for Michelle Torres and Amanda Chen."

The room went silent except for the ventilation system. Webb's expression shifted to guarded concern. "Those are closed cases."

"I'm aware. I'd still like to review them."

Webb looked to Morrison for support. Morrison sipped his coffee, offering nothing. Finally Webb sighed. "I'll have my assistant pull the files. But I stand by those determinations."

"Understood."

They left the autopsy room with Webb's reluctant cooperation secured. Morrison led the way upstairs in silence, and Brennan could feel the weight of unspoken judgment. Less than twenty-four hours in Depoe Bay and she'd already alienated the sheriff and the medical examiner.

The briefing room was on the second floor—long table, folding chairs, windows overlooking the parking lot. Sheriff Garland was already there with two deputies and a woman in civilian clothes who introduced herself as Deputy Chief Sarah Walters.

Garland didn't waste time on pleasantries. "Dr. Webb says you're asking about old cases."

"Cases with similar characteristics," Brennan said, taking a seat across from him. Morrison sat beside her, a subtle alignment that didn't go unnoticed.

"Michelle Torres and Amanda Chen died in accidents. Both cases were thoroughly investigated and properly closed."

"I'd like to review those investigations."

"To what purpose?" Garland's face was flushed, his voice tight with controlled anger. "You've been here one day and you're second-guessing two years of work by good people doing their jobs."

"I'm looking for patterns, Sheriff. That's what the Behavioral Science Unit does."

"What you're doing is stirring up trouble. Tourist season is at peak. We've got motels booked solid, restaurants full, fishing charters going out every day. You start talking about serial killers and this town loses everything."

"Three women are dead."

"Three women drowned. People drown on this coast every year. The caves are dangerous. We put up signs, we warn people, but they don't listen. Seasonal kids come here thinking it's all beach parties and summer romance. They take risks and sometimes those risks kill them."

Brennan kept her voice level. "Sheriff Garland, I understand the economic concerns. But if there's any possibility these deaths are connected—"

"There isn't."

"Then let me review the files and confirm that. If I'm wrong, you can document that the FBI investigated and found no pattern. That's actually helpful for you."

Garland leaned back, arms folded. "And if you decide you've found a pattern? If you go to the press?"

"I don't talk to the press without cause." Brennan met his eyes. "But I need those files. I can get them through Salem and Portland with forms that take weeks. Or you can provide them now."

Deputy Chief Walters cleared her throat. "Sheriff, the agent has jurisdiction. If she requests through official channels, we'll have to comply anyway. Better to cooperate now than look obstructionist later."

Garland's jaw worked. "Fine. Morrison, you coordinate with Agent Brennan on file access. But this stays quiet. No press, no panic. You find your pattern or you don't, and then you leave. Clear?"

"Clear," Brennan said.

The briefing dissolved with grudging cooperation replacing hostility. She followed Morrison into morning sunshine that had burned through the fog.

"You've got a real gift for making friends," Morrison said.

"I'm not here to make friends."

"No kidding." He walked toward his pickup. "Come on. I'll buy you lunch while we wait for the clerk to pull those files."

The diner was called the Spouting Horn, occupying a corner lot with ocean views. Dark wood paneling and nautical decor—nets and buoys and a ship's wheel behind the counter. Tables were full with tourists and locals.

Morrison chose a booth in the back. A waitress appeared immediately, calling Morrison by name and eyeing Brennan with curiosity that felt like the whole town's attention.

"I'll take the Fisherman's Special," Morrison said. "She'll have the same."

The waitress left without asking if Brennan wanted a choice. Morrison caught her look. "It's clam chowder and a crab sandwich. Best thing on the menu. Trust me."

"I'm starting to think trust is in short supply here."

"You haven't earned it yet." Morrison wrapped his hands around his coffee cup. "So explain to me why you're so certain this is murder. Not theory, not Bureau methodology. What makes you sure?"

Brennan considered how much to share. Morrison was state police, technically on her side, but he was also Oregon born and raised, part of this community in ways she'd never be. Still, she needed at least one ally.

"Three victims," she said. "Three summers. Same victim profile—college age females, seasonal workers, outgoing personalities. All found in sea caves at low tide. All with blunt force trauma attributed to rocks. All with bodies positioned in ways that were noted as unusual but dismissed."

"People drown in caves. That's not a pattern, that's probability."

"The symbols are the pattern. Jennifer Kowalski was reaching toward fresh carvings. If Torres and Chen have similar symbols in their scene photos, that's not coincidence. That's signature."

Morrison was quiet, staring at the ocean visible between buildings. "You know what happens if you're right? This town doesn't just lose tourism. It loses its identity. Depoe Bay is safe, quiet, a place where nothing bad happens. Serial killer changes that forever."

"The victims' families might argue something bad already happened."

"Yeah." Morrison rubbed his face. "Yeah, they would."

The waitress brought their food—thick chowder in bread bowls, sandwiches on sourdough. They ate in silence for a few minutes.

"Tell me about the Behavioral Science Unit," Morrison said finally. "How does pattern analysis actually work?"

Brennan set down her spoon. "We look for commonalities across cases. Geography, victim demographics, timing, method, signature behaviors. Most violent crimes are opportunistic. But serial offenders plan. They select victims for specific reasons. They follow patterns because the pattern is part of what satisfies them."

"And you think that's what we have here? Someone selecting seasonal workers because they're outsiders, killing them in caves because that's part of his fantasy?"

"I think someone has access to these women, knowledge of the caves and tides, and a reason to stage bodies with symbols. That's organized behavior. That's not accident."

Morrison pushed his plate away. "The file clerk said it'll be an hour before the files are ready. You want to see their crime scene locations while we wait?"

"Yes."

"Fair warning—one of them is where I helped rule it an accident."

"If I'm right, the person who killed these women has been operating for three years without anyone noticing. That's not your failure. That's his success."

Morrison stood, dropping bills on the table. "Let's hope you're wrong, Agent Brennan. Because if you're right, we've got a killer who's very good at what he does."

They left into bright afternoon sun, the ocean glittering beyond the highway, tourist families walking past with ice cream. Everything looked like a picture-perfect coastal town.

Brennan knew better than to trust surfaces.
