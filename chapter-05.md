# Chapter 5: Archive Patterns

The county records room occupied the courthouse basement's deepest corner, a windowless space that smelled of old paper and mildew. Steel shelving units lined the walls floor to ceiling, crammed with file boxes labeled by year and case type. A single work table sat under fluorescent lights that hummed like distant insects.

Brennan and Morrison arrived at eight in the morning with coffee and a handwritten list of search parameters. The county clerk, Helen Moffett, had grudgingly provided access after Garland's authorization came through.

"Coastal death files from 1975 through 1978," she'd said, pointing to three shelving units. "Organized by year, then chronologically. Cross-reference manually—we don't have a computerized index. Sign the log when you remove boxes, return them in order when done."

Now those boxes sat stacked on the table.

Morrison took 1975 and 1976. Brennan started with 1977. Each file contained incident reports, witness statements, coroner's notes, occasionally photographs. Most were straightforward tragedies—fishing accidents, hypothermia, people swept off rocks. The Oregon coast was beautiful and deadly in equal measure.

"How do we know what we're looking for?" Morrison asked after the first hour, having reviewed a dozen drowning cases that fit no pattern beyond bad luck and poor judgment.

"Female, college age, found in sea cave at low tide, death ruled accidental drowning." Brennan made notes on a legal pad. "The specifics will vary, but those core elements should be consistent."

"That's still pretty broad."

"Which is why it took three years for anyone to notice."

They worked in silence punctuated by pages turning and pen scratching paper. The air was stale, the fluorescent lights making everything look green. Brennan's eyes ached from reading faded reports, some with carbon copies barely legible.

At ten-thirty, Morrison stopped. "I've got something."

Brennan looked up from a file about a logger who'd drowned while drunk.

"Michelle Torres, nineteen, found July 18th, 1976 in a sea cave three miles north of Depoe Bay." Morrison read from the report. "Body discovered by hikers at low tide. Worked at Sea Vista Motel for the summer. Death ruled accidental drowning with head trauma attributed to falling on rocks."

Brennan moved beside him, reading over his shoulder. The report was sparse—two pages plus coroner's brief. Torres last seen the previous evening at a beach gathering. When she didn't show for her shift, coworkers assumed she'd slept in. Hikers found her around noon.

"Does it mention body position?" Brennan asked.

Morrison flipped to the coroner's notes. "Unusual positioning noted—victim on back with arms extended forward. ME attributed this to tidal movement and current. No signs of sexual assault. Seawater in lungs consistent with drowning. Blunt force trauma to posterior skull consistent with rock impact."

"That's our pattern." Brennan felt pieces clicking into place. "What about photographs?"

"Report references scene photos, archived separately." Morrison checked the file box. "Photos aren't here—they must be in evidence storage."

Brennan made detailed notes: victim name, date, location, age, employment, circumstances, positioning. "One match could be coincidence. We need the second."

They returned to the files. Another hour passed. Brennan's handwriting got messier as fatigue strained her eyes. Her coffee had gone cold. Morrison worked methodically, reading every 1976 file before moving to 1977.

At noon, Brennan found it.

"Amanda Chen, twenty-two, University of Washington student. Found July 31st, 1977 in a sea cave five miles south of Depoe Bay. Worked at Surfside Restaurant. Last seen leaving work around ten PM. Body discovered next morning by local fisherman checking tide pools."

Morrison came around the table. They read together.

The incident report was more detailed than Torres'—Morrison's name appeared on the investigating officer line. Brennan glanced at him and saw his jaw tighten as he read his own words from a year ago.

"I remember this case," he said quietly. "The fisherman—old guy named Pete Reyes—was pretty shaken. Said he'd been checking that cave for forty years and never seen anything like it."

"Like what?"

"The way she was lying. He said it looked like she was reaching for something on the wall, but there was nothing there. Just rock." Morrison's finger traced his own words. "I noted unusual body position, arms extended toward cave wall. But the ME said tidal action could explain it. Garland wanted it closed fast, said we had no evidence of foul play. I had doubts, but not enough to push back."

Brennan read the coroner's notes. The same findings: blunt force trauma, seawater in lungs, accidental drowning. The same dismissal of unusual positioning as natural tidal movement.

"Were there symbols on the wall?" she asked.

"I don't remember any. But I wasn't looking for them either. I was focused on the body, the immediate scene." Morrison rubbed his eyes. "If I'd paid more attention—"

"You followed procedure. You noted the unusual positioning. The failure was systemic, not personal." Brennan meant it. Pattern recognition required seeing across multiple cases, which meant access Morrison hadn't had. "Do you remember if photographs were taken?"

"Yeah. I shot a roll myself, plus the ME's photographer. They should be in evidence storage with Torres photos."

Brennan laid out her notes: Torres 1976, Chen 1977, Kowalski 1978. "Look at this."

Morrison studied the pattern emerging across three years:

Torres: July 18, 1976. Age 19. Sea Vista Motel employee. Found in cave, low tide. Body positioned with extended arms. Head trauma. Ruled accidental.

Chen: July 31, 1977. Age 22. Surfside Restaurant employee. Found in cave, low tide. Body positioned with extended arms. Head trauma. Ruled accidental.

Kowalski: July 15, 1978. Age 21. Tidewater Motel employee. Found in cave, low tide. Body positioned with extended arms. Head trauma. Currently ruled accidental.

"Three years," Morrison said. "Three Julys. Three seasonal workers. Three caves. Three times we called it accident."

"All college-age females. All employed in service jobs catering to tourists. All outgoing enough to work public-facing positions. All found at low tide in caves that require local knowledge to access."

"And all positioned the same way, which got noted but dismissed."

Brennan pulled out the grainy photograph from Chen's incident file she'd discovered last night. Under the work table's bright light, the carved symbols on the cave wall were slightly more visible. "The pattern extends to the signature elements. He's been doing this the same way from the beginning."

Morrison was quiet, staring at the three files. "Why July?"

"Peak tourist season. Maximum seasonal workers. Highest concentration of potential victims. He can select from a larger pool."

"Why one per year?"

"Restraint. Control. Maybe the ritual requires specific conditions—the right victim, the right tide cycle. Serial offenders often have cooling-off periods. One per year suggests he's patient, disciplined."

"And confident he won't be caught."

"Yes."

Morrison walked to the shelving units, looking at file boxes stretching back years. "Should we check earlier? See if there's a victim before Torres?"

"Yes, but let's secure these three first. We need those photographs from evidence storage—proper scene photos. If the symbols appear in all three scenes, we have undeniable pattern."

Morrison pulled over the room's phone, an old rotary model covered in dust. He dialed evidence storage in Newport, explained what they needed, got transferred twice. Brennan listened: patient but insistent, using his state police credentials.

When he hung up, his expression said it all. "Photos are in off-site storage. They can pull and send them, but it'll take three to four days."

"Days?" Brennan felt frustration spike. "This is a serial murder investigation."

"They don't know that. To them, it's cold case review. Non-urgent." Morrison held up a hand. "I pushed as hard as I could without revealing why. If we tell evidence storage we're investigating serial murder, that gets back to Garland, and he shuts us down before we have proof."

He was right, which made it no less frustrating. "What about the ME's copies? Dr. Webb would have photographs."

"He's pulling those files today. We should have them this afternoon." Morrison checked his watch. "It's almost one. You hungry?"

Brennan realized she'd forgotten to eat. "We should finish reviewing the remaining years first."

"We've been in this basement for five hours. We need food and fresh air, or we're going to miss things." Morrison started returning files to boxes. "Twenty minutes for lunch, then we finish."

They ate sandwiches from the diner at a picnic table outside the courthouse, sitting in sunshine that felt sharp after hours under fluorescent lights. The July afternoon was warm, tourists walking past with ice cream, ocean sound constant and close.

"Three women," Morrison said, staring at his sandwich. "Three women who came here for summer work and beach parties, and instead found a killer. And we—I—ruled them accidents."

"The system failed them," Brennan said. "Different jurisdictions, different investigators, year-long gaps. No one had the full picture."

"We should have seen it."

"Now we do." She met his eyes. "Now we stop him before there's a fourth."

They finished in silence, then returned to the basement and remaining file boxes. Three more hours covering 1975 and early 1978 before Kowalski. They found multiple drownings, several in caves, but none matching the specific pattern: young female, seasonal worker, July, positioned with extended arms.

"So Torres is victim one as far as we can document," Brennan said. "He might have killed before 1975, but the method or victim profile was different enough not to match."

"Or he just started in '76."

"Possible. Some offenders develop their method over time."

Morrison restacked the last file box. "So where do we go from here? We have pattern, we have victims, but we don't have suspect or probable cause."

"We wait for photographs to confirm symbols at all three scenes. We cross-reference maritime records for people with cave knowledge and victim access. We interview seasonal workers about who paid unusual attention. We build a profile and narrow the pool." Brennan gathered her notes. "And we hope he doesn't escalate before we identify him."

They signed out with Helen Moffett, who looked relieved to have her record room back. Brennan and Morrison emerged into late afternoon sunshine, carrying boxes of copied files.

"I'll drop you at your motel," Morrison said. "Dr. Webb said he'd have those autopsy files ready by five. I'll pick them up and bring them to your office tonight."

"Thank you."

They drove through Depoe Bay, past motels and surf shops and tourists enjoying picture-perfect coastal summer. Somewhere in this town, someone was going about their day—working, eating, watching television. Someone who knew these streets and caves intimately. Someone patient and controlled enough to kill once a year for three years.

Someone invisible because everyone looked right past him.

Brennan stared out the window at passing storefronts, memorizing faces. The killer was here. In plain sight. She just had to find him before July claimed another victim.
