# BIBLE: CAVE MOUTHS

## Story Premise

July 1978. FBI behavioral analyst Sarah Brennan arrives in Depoe Bay, Oregon to investigate what local authorities insist are accidental drownings. Three college students working summer resort jobs have been found dead in sea caves over three consecutive summers, each body ritualistically positioned with hands reaching toward occult symbols carved into cave walls. When a Zodiac-style postcard arrives at the local newspaper with cryptic messages about "returning to the sea," Brennan teams with burned-out Oregon State Detective Jack Morrison to hunt a killer who uses tide tables as his murder schedule. The investigation uncovers a tight-knit coastal community protecting dark secrets, a surf culture hostile to outsider college workers, and a killer with intimate knowledge of maritime systems. As summer tourist season peaks and another student vanishes, the investigators must decode the postcards and navigate treacherous cave systems before the next tide cycle claims another victim.

## Lead Investigator Profile

**Sarah Brennan, 28, FBI Behavioral Science Unit**

Sarah Brennan built her early FBI career on one skill: pattern recognition. Recruited from a criminology PhD program at Boston University in 1975, she spent three years in the Behavioral Science Unit analyzing cases other agents found too ambiguous. She sees connections others miss - geographic clusters, timeline correlations, symbolic repetitions. This makes her invaluable to the Bureau and exhausting to work with. She arrived in Depoe Bay with file boxes, colored markers, and absolute certainty that three "accidental drownings" constitute serial murder.

Her investigative approach is methodical and relentless. She treats crime scenes like archaeological sites, believing every detail means something. She catalogs, photographs, cross-references. Where Morrison sees a carved symbol, Brennan sees maritime folk magic, historical precedent, psychological signature. She interviews witnesses with prepared question lists and takes notes in shorthand. Her strength is connecting disparate evidence into coherent narrative; her weakness is trusting her patterns more than people.

Personality-wise, Brennan is direct, sometimes blunt. She has little patience for bureaucratic obstacles or community politics. She doesn't soften her conclusions to make local authorities comfortable. This won't win friends in Depoe Bay, but she's not here to make friends. However, beneath the analytical armor is genuine determination to speak for victims others dismissed. She's professional but not cold - she remembers victims' names, details from their lives, why they mattered.

Physically, Brennan is compact and precise - 5'4", dark hair kept in a practical bun, always wearing Bureau-appropriate pantsuits that mark her as hopelessly East Coast in this beach town. She moves with efficiency, carries a leather briefcase instead of the standard-issue bag, and has a habit of tapping her pen against her notepad when thinking.

What she brings to this case: analytical framework, federal resources, refusal to accept "accident" as explanation, and the outsider perspective needed to see what locals won't acknowledge. What she needs to learn: how to navigate a community that values silence over truth, and when to trust human instinct over data patterns.

## Partner Investigator Profile

**Jack Morrison, 32, Oregon State Police Detective**

Jack Morrison has spent eight years with Oregon State Police working the coast range - logging accidents, domestic violence calls, highway fatalities, and the occasional drowning. He's seen enough death to recognize when a case doesn't sit right, but he's also learned that sometimes the simple explanation is true: people make mistakes, the ocean is dangerous, accidents happen. When the FBI requested state cooperation on the Depoe Bay drownings, Morrison drew the assignment because he knows coastal culture and won't escalate tensions with locals.

His investigative approach is grounded and people-focused. Morrison builds rapport, asks open-ended questions, knows when to push and when to let silence do the work. He grew up in Oregon logging country, understands insular communities that distrust outsiders, and can shift his presentation from official detective to "just asking around." Where Brennan sees patterns in evidence, Morrison reads people - their hesitations, their deflections, what they're protecting. His strength is human intelligence; his weakness is occasionally accepting surface explanations when deeper truth requires uncomfortable digging.

Morrison is tired. Not checked-out tired, but weathered. He's worked too many logging deaths, talked to too many widows, scraped too many teenagers off Highway 101. Part of him wants the Depoe Bay case to be accidents because that's simpler than believing someone is hunting college kids in sea caves. Partnering with an intense FBI analyst who sees conspiracy in everything pushes against his instinct to keep things calm. But Morrison is fundamentally honest - if Brennan's right and these are murders, he'll work the case properly.

Personality-wise, he's steady, occasionally sardonic, protective of his jurisdiction but not territorial about credit. He treats Brennan with professional respect even when her theories seem far-fetched. He has a dry sense of humor that surfaces during stake-outs and long drives. He's comfortable with silence, which sometimes unnerves chattier witnesses into talking.

Physically, Morrison is tall and rangy - 6'1", sandy hair going gray at the temples, usually in jeans and a work shirt rather than detective-issue suit. He drives an unmarked Ford pickup that doesn't scream "cop" in rural areas. He moves deliberately, never rushes, has a handshake that lingers just long enough to take someone's measure.

What he brings: local knowledge, community access, interview skills, and grounded skepticism that keeps Brennan's pattern-chasing tethered to reality. The partnership dynamic is productive friction - her urgency versus his patience, her data versus his instinct, outsider versus insider. Light professional chemistry emerges through mutual respect for competence, but no romance subplot.

## Killer Profile

**Leonard Pruitt, 45, Maritime Rescue Volunteer & Commercial Fisherman**

Leonard Pruitt has lived in Depoe Bay his entire life, the son and grandson of commercial fishermen. He's worked the waters since age fourteen, knows every reef, current, and tide pattern along this stretch of coast. For twenty years he's volunteered with local maritime rescue, responding to emergencies in conditions other people won't risk. The community respects him as someone who knows the ocean intimately and has saved lives. This reputation provides perfect cover and access.

Pruitt's job enables the crimes in multiple ways. As a rescue volunteer, he monitors marine radio frequencies and tide schedules obsessively, can explain being anywhere on the coast at any time ("checking on reports" or "routine patrol"), and has keys to the harbormaster's office where tide tables and cave maps are stored. As a commercial fisherman, he keeps irregular hours, owns a boat allowing discrete transportation, and his solitary nature is accepted as occupational. The community sees him as dedicated to ocean safety, never questioning his presence near beaches or caves.

His psychological framework is rooted in a distorted sense of guardianship. Pruitt genuinely loves the ocean and the cave systems, which he views as sacred spaces being desecrated by disrespectful outsiders. The college students working summer resort jobs represent everything he resents - temporary invaders treating Depoe Bay as a playground, showing no reverence for the ocean's power, partying on beaches where his grandfather drowned. He selects victims who he witnesses "disrespecting" the water - swimming drunk, littering, laughing at local warnings. In his mind, he's not murdering; he's "returning them to the sea" as offerings or lessons.

His MO combines ritualistic staging with tide table precision. He approaches victims when they're isolated, incapacitates them (usually blunt force trauma during cave exploration he offers to guide), and positions bodies in specific caves at specific tide cycles so they'll be discovered during the next low tide. The carved symbols are his own invention mixing maritime folklore and personal mythology. The Zodiac-style postcards feed his need for attention while maintaining the mystery he believes the caves deserve.

Pruitt is caught through traditional police work - his name appears in maritime volunteer logs, his boat is spotted near crime scenes, his typewriter matches the postcards, and his obsessive tide schedule monitoring reveals the pattern. He's not a genius; he's a local who exploited his position and knowledge until investigators started looking at the community itself rather than accepting "accidents."

## Supporting Characters

**Sheriff Roy Garland, 54, Depoe Bay County Sheriff**

Garland has been sheriff for sixteen years and sees his primary job as maintaining tourist season revenue. Three drownings over three years is unfortunate but not suspicious in a coastal town where people ignore warning signs daily. He ruled each case accidental drowning, resents FBI involvement as federal overreach, and views Brennan as a careerist making problems where none exist. He's not corrupt, just committed to the simple explanation and protective of Depoe Bay's reputation. Provides minimal cooperation, defensive in briefings, represents institutional resistance Morrison must navigate and Brennan must overcome. Connection: childhood friend of Pruitt, vouched for his character, will struggle when evidence points to someone he trusts.

**Dr. Martin Webb, 61, County Medical Examiner**

Webb serves three coastal counties from an office in Newport, handles mostly natural deaths and accidents, hasn't seen a homicide in eight years. He's competent but not ambitious, filed the drowning reports Garland wanted without pushing back. When Brennan requests re-examination of previous victims' files, Webb is professionally accommodating if slightly embarrassed he missed evidence of staging. Becomes crucial ally once convinced these are murders - provides forensic details, confirms ritualistic positioning couldn't be accident, testifies to blunt force trauma initially attributed to rocks. Represents the professional who follows evidence over politics once shown the pattern.

**Rita Sanderson, 38, Owner of the Tidewater Motel**

Rita employs the seasonal college workers, including two of the victims. She's pragmatic, financially stretched, and needs summer revenue to survive the off-season. She's helpful to investigators but careful - doesn't want to scare off workers or tourists. Provides insight into the victims' lives, the surf culture dynamics, and tensions between locals and college kids. She notices things - who watches the workers too closely, which locals make the students uncomfortable - but needs Morrison's rapport-building before sharing observations. Represents the working-class local caught between community loyalty and doing right by her dead employees.

**Tommy Vickers, 26, Surf Shop Owner & Former Coast Guard**

Tommy runs a beachfront surf shop catering to tourists and college workers, making him marginal in both communities - too commercial for old-guard locals, too local for the seasonal crowd. He's helpful to investigators, perhaps too helpful, offering to guide them through cave systems and identify surf culture members. Served four years Coast Guard, honorable discharge, knows maritime rescue protocols. Functions as red herring mid-investigation - his eagerness and knowledge make him briefly suspicious until alibi confirmed. Ultimately provides key insight: Pruitt had been asking him questions about which college workers go into caves, masked as safety concerns.

**Eleanor Pruitt, 72, Leonard's Mother**

Eleanor is a Depoe Bay institution, widow of a fisherman lost at sea in 1956, raised Leonard alone in the old fishing cottage on the bluff. She's sharp-minded, proud, and fiercely protective of her son's reputation. When investigators come asking about Leonard, she's hostile and defensive, insisting he's a hero who saves lives. Her testimony about Leonard's obsession with the caves - which she frames as dedication and reverence - inadvertently provides psychological profile. Represents the community's protective instinct and the tragedy of a mother unable to see what her son became.

**Angela Hartley, 21, University of Oregon Student & Potential Victim**

Angela is the fourth victim in timeline - she survives as the intended target in Act 3 when Morrison interrupts Pruitt. She works at the Tidewater Motel housekeeping, outgoing and friendly, popular with other seasonal workers. She appears in earlier chapters during witness canvassing, provides details about feeling watched, mentions that Pruitt offered to show her "the safe caves" which she declined. Her journal (discovered when she goes missing) contains the crucial detail about "someone who knows the tides" watching the workers. Functions as both witness and victim, her rescue provides the dramatic confrontation that brings Pruitt's capture.

## Setting Details

**Location: Depoe Bay, Oregon - July 1978**

Depoe Bay sits on the central Oregon coast, calling itself "the world's smallest harbor" - a town of roughly 650 permanent residents swelling to several thousand during summer tourist season. The harbor is a narrow channel carved through basalt rock, connected to the Pacific by a gap barely wide enough for fishing boats at high tide. Rocky coastline stretches north and south, dramatic basalt headlands and sea caves carved by millennia of wave action. Highway 101 runs through the center of town, lined with motels, surf shops, saltwater taffy stores, and seafood restaurants with ocean views.

The investigation centers around several key locations. Morrison and Brennan work from a borrowed office in the county courthouse annex, a cramped room with water-stained ceiling tiles and a rotary phone that requires going through a switchboard operator. The Tidewater Motel on the south end of town serves as employment center for victims - a 1950s-era motor court with twenty units, office with nautical decor, and a view of the working harbor. The Depoe Bay Beacon newspaper office is a converted storefront where the Zodiac postcards arrive, run by a husband-wife team who must balance journalism against community pressure. The Anchor Tavern is the local gathering spot where fishermen and longtime residents drink, where Morrison builds rapport and Brennan stands out uncomfortably. The harbormaster's office contains tide tables, cave maps, and maritime rescue logs that become crucial evidence.

The sea caves themselves are the heart of the case. Three caves are crime scenes, each accessible only during low tide windows, each with carved symbols on walls, each chosen for specific tidal timing. The caves have local names - "Smuggler's Rest," "Echo Chamber," "The Cathedral" - and folklore the old-timers won't fully share. Accessing them requires knowledge of tide schedules, rock climbing ability, and willingness to risk being trapped by incoming water. The caves are beautiful and terrifying - cathedral-like spaces carved from black basalt, tidepools teeming with sea life, the constant sound of ocean echo, and the very real danger of drowning if you miscalculate the tide.

July weather is Oregon coastal perfect - morning fog burning off by noon, temperatures in the 60s-70s, long summer daylight extending investigative hours. Tourist season is full swing with families, surfers, and seasonal workers creating the busy backdrop that allows a killer to operate unnoticed. The fog becomes significant in atmosphere and plot - it rolls in unpredictably, reducing visibility, creating isolation even in a crowded town.

Period details anchor the 1978 setting. Investigators use payphones and wait for callbacks, maintain handwritten case notes and typed reports on carbon copy paper, send evidence to Portland for lab analysis that takes days or weeks. No cell phones means coordination is difficult; no computers means cross-referencing is manual work. The local radio station plays FM rock - Fleetwood Mac, Eagles, Bob Seger - from the Tidewater Motel office. Cars are 1970s American boats - Morrison drives a Ford pickup, Brennan has a Bureau-issue Plymouth sedan. Gas is expensive due to the energy crisis, which matters when driving coastal highways for interviews.

The setting creates specific investigation challenges. The coastal geography isolates Depoe Bay - it's two hours from any major city, accessed by a two-lane highway that winds through headlands and forest. The tide cycle dictates when crime scenes are accessible, forcing investigators to work around nature's schedule. The tight-knit fishing community views outsiders with suspicion, especially federal authorities who've historically regulated their industry. The seasonal worker population is transient by definition, hard to track, and viewed by locals as temporary and therefore disposable.

Visual identity is crucial: basalt rock contrasted against green-white surf, weathered fishing boats in a too-small harbor, fog obscuring then revealing coastline, the geometric beauty of sea caves, faded motor court neon, and the endless Pacific horizon. This is picture-postcard Oregon coast with something dark underneath.

## Victim Profile & Pattern

The victims are college students aged 19-22 working summer resort jobs in Depoe Bay. They come from universities in California, Washington, and Oregon, attracted by want ads promising beach access and summer wages. They're not locals - they're outsiders working housekeeping, restaurant service, surf shop retail, and motel desk shifts. This transient seasonal worker population provides the killer with vulnerable targets whose disappearances don't immediately trigger intensive investigation.

What connects them: All four victims are young women, outgoing personalities, comfortable around the ocean but not experienced with its dangers. They participate in the beach bonfire and surf culture, befriend other seasonal workers, and treat Depoe Bay as a summer adventure rather than a serious place. Crucially, Pruitt observed each victim doing something he perceived as "disrespecting the ocean" - swimming while intoxicated, littering on beaches, laughing at local warnings about cave dangers, or treating sacred spaces as casual entertainment.

The timeline spans three summers: Summer 1976 (Victim 1 - ruled accidental drowning), Summer 1977 (Victim 2 - ruled accidental drowning), Summer 1978 (Victim 3 discovered in Chapter 1, Victim 4 attempted in Act 3). The escalating pattern wasn't recognized because different agencies handled each case as isolated accidents, files weren't cross-referenced, and the year-long gaps prevented pattern recognition until FBI review.

Body disposal follows specific ritual: Victims are incapacitated through blunt force trauma (hit from behind with rock or boat equipment), then transported to predetermined sea caves during low tide. Bodies are positioned with hands reaching toward symbols Pruitt carves into cave walls - maritime folk magic symbols he's invented or adapted. The positioning appears ritualistic, as though the victims are "offering themselves" to the sea. Pruitt times everything to tide schedules so bodies are discovered during the next low tide cycle, usually by tourists or locals exploring caves.

The pattern wasn't recognized earlier because: (1) Different agencies responded to each incident, (2) Sheriff Garland preferred simple explanations, (3) Victims were transient workers with no local family pressure, (4) Year-long gaps prevented obvious connection, (5) Cave deaths are not uncommon on dangerous coastlines, (6) No Zodiac postcards until summer 1978 when Pruitt escalated his attention-seeking behavior. The FBI behavioral unit flagged the case only after receiving a request for consultation on the 1978 victim, prompting file review that revealed the pattern.

## Investigation Framework

**Jurisdictional Setup:** The case technically falls under Depoe Bay County Sheriff jurisdiction (Sheriff Garland), but the FBI became involved when the Behavioral Science Unit reviewed coastal drowning statistics and flagged the sea cave pattern as potentially serial. The Bureau requested Oregon State Police cooperation for local liaison, leading to Morrison's assignment. This creates a three-agency friction: Garland resents federal overreach and wants the case to remain accidents, Morrison is caught between supporting his state jurisdiction and recognizing Brennan's evidence is compelling, and Brennan has federal authority but needs local cooperation to function.

**Isolation Mechanisms:** Three factors keep this case contained and "cosy" rather than media circus. (1) Geographic isolation: Depoe Bay is remote, two hours from Portland, accessible by a single coastal highway. Bodies are found in caves requiring tide-table knowledge and rock climbing to access, creating literal physical barriers to investigation. (2) Social marginalization: Victims are transient seasonal workers with no local family presence or community advocacy. They're viewed as temporary outsiders, reducing community investment in their deaths. (3) Institutional resistance: Sheriff Garland actively suppresses case severity to protect tourist economy. The local newspaper is pressured to downplay the story. The community conspiracy of silence treats investigation cooperation as disloyalty.

**Resources and Limitations:** Morrison has access to Oregon State Police resources but must request them through proper channels, creating delays. Brennan can call on FBI lab analysis, behavioral profiles, and database searches, but everything requires physical evidence transport to Portland or Quantico with days or weeks turnaround time. The local sheriff's department provides grudging minimal support - no dedicated officers, limited file access, defensive responses to questions. The 1970s technology constraints are significant: no cell phones means constant searching for payphones, no computers means manual cross-referencing of records, no DNA analysis means relying on fingerprints and blood typing, and photographic evidence requires film development delays.

**Community Cooperation/Resistance:** The fishing community and longtime Depoe Bay residents view the investigation as threat to their reputation and livelihood. Tourist season revenue is essential for survival, and serial killer publicity would devastate the local economy. Witnesses are reluctant to talk, especially to Brennan (FBI, female, East Coast outsider). Morrison has better luck with his Oregon credentials and patient approach, but even he faces resistance. The seasonal workers are more cooperative but scared - they want to help but also need their summer jobs and don't want to believe they're in danger.

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

The narrative voice should feel documentary in texture - observational, precise, trusting reader intelligence rather than explaining everything. Think of a well-researched true crime account or quality procedural journalism. The prose is clean and atmospheric without purple embellishment. Show the 1970s coastal Oregon setting through specific details (rotary phones, typewriters, period music, gas crisis mentions) rather than historical exposition dumps.

Pacing rhythm alternates between active investigation scenes (interviews, evidence analysis, searches) and quieter character moments (drives along coastal highway, waiting for callbacks, coffee at the diner). Use the ocean itself as pacing element - the tide cycle creates natural deadlines and rhythm, fog rolls in to create isolation, the constant sound of surf provides atmospheric baseline. Chapter endings should hook without melodrama - a new piece of evidence, a witness contradiction, a discovered connection.

Atmospheric emphasis prioritizes place as character. The sea caves, the too-small harbor, the fog, the basalt coastline, the shabby-genteel motor courts - these should feel vivid and specific. Balance investigation procedural (evidence chains, warrant requirements, jurisdictional protocols) with character moments that reveal Brennan and Morrison's developing partnership. The investigation provides structure, but the human moments provide texture.

Avoid theatrical melodrama, villain mythology (Pruitt is a killer, not a monster), hard-boiled cynicism, or romance subplot. Trust that readers are intelligent enough to appreciate restraint. The horror is in the reality - someone used his community position to murder young women and nearly got away with it because everyone wanted to believe the simple explanation. That's disturbing enough without embellishment.

Period authenticity should feel natural, not forced. Don't stop narrative to explain 1970s technology; simply show investigators using payphones and waiting for callbacks. Reference period music, vehicles, prices, cultural touchstones when organic to scene. The tone is sophisticated nostalgia - awareness that this era had both appeal (slower pace, tangible investigation work) and limitations (communication delays, forensic technology gaps, institutional sexism Brennan navigates).

## Central Mystery Structure

**Major Clues and Placement:** Chapter 1 establishes ritualistic staging and carved symbols. Chapter 5 reveals pattern of previous "accidents" in archive search. Chapter 6 introduces Zodiac postcards linking to tide tables. Chapter 12-13 identifies maritime knowledge as killer requirement. Chapter 15 provides victim's journal mentioning being watched by "someone who knows the tides." Chapter 20-21 narrows to maritime rescue volunteer profile and Pruitt identification. Chapter 24 cracks postcard code revealing next cave location.

**Red Herrings and False Leads:** Tommy Vickers (surf shop owner, too helpful, Coast Guard background) draws suspicion mid-investigation but has solid alibi. The town's dark history with the caves (1920s smuggling, 1940s murder-suicide) seems connected but is ultimately atmospheric context rather than motive. An elderly fisherman's evasiveness about the caves suggests guilt but actually protects illegal fishing spots. The symbols appear occult but are Pruitt's personal invention with no deeper meaning.

**Fair Play Elements:** Readers have access to same information as investigators. Pruitt appears in background early (Chapter 7 surf community interviews, mentioned by harbormaster as dedicated rescue volunteer). His name is in maritime volunteer logs investigators review. The tide table obsession is mentioned by multiple witnesses as Pruitt's known characteristic. The journal entry about "someone who knows the tides" is presented when discovered. Readers can theoretically solve the case before reveal, but Pruitt's respected community position and the red herrings provide misdirection.

**Investigation Milestones:** Act 1 ends with pattern recognition (serial murders, not accidents). Early Act 2 establishes victim profile and killer requirements (maritime knowledge, cave access, local presence). Mid Act 2 narrows suspect pool through witness interviews and background checks. Late Act 2 identifies Pruitt specifically through convergent evidence. Act 3 focuses on evidence gathering for arrest, postcard decoding, and final confrontation.

**Resolution Structure:** The breakthrough comes through traditional police work - cross-referencing logs, Morrison's witness rapport-building, Brennan's pattern analysis of postcards and tide tables. Chapter 24 decodes next cave location. Chapter 25-26 race against tide schedule leads to Morrison discovering Pruitt with intended victim Angela. The confrontation is dangerous but not theatrical - Morrison nearly trapped by rising tide, backup arrives, Pruitt captured through overwhelming force not detective cleverness. Chapter 28 interrogation reveals full scope (four victims, twisted guardian mythology). Chapter 29 wraps evidence. Chapter 30 provides quiet resolution - victims' families notified, Brennan and Morrison depart, community still protecting its reputation, justice served but no triumphalism.

The mystery satisfies through fair play clue distribution, grounded police procedural work, and acknowledgment that the killer succeeded three times because institutions failed. The resolution is competent investigation overcoming community resistance, not hero worship.
