# Chapter 3: The Tidewater Motel

The Tidewater Motel sat on the south end of town, a horseshoe-shaped motor court from the 1950s with twenty units painted turquoise and white. The sign out front featured a faded leaping marlin, and the office had porthole windows.

Brennan and Morrison arrived at four in the afternoon. The parking lot held out-of-state vehicles—California plates, Washington, Idaho.

The office smelled like coffee and salt air. A woman in her late thirties sat behind the counter, going through reservation cards. She looked up as they entered, expression shifting from professional welcome to something heavier.

"Mrs. Sanderson?" Morrison said. "I'm Detective Morrison. This is Agent Brennan with the FBI."

Rita Sanderson stood, wiping her hands on her jeans. "Of course. Come around back. We can talk in my apartment."

She led them through a door into a small living space—filing cabinets, a kitchenette, a couch with nautical pillows. Family photos showed a younger Rita with a husband and two kids, though Brennan saw no evidence of them now.

"Can I get you coffee?"

"No thank you," Brennan said. Morrison accepted, and Rita poured him a cup with hands that shook slightly.

"Jennifer," Rita said, sitting on the couch. "I still can't believe it. She was here three days ago laughing with the other girls. And now..."

"How long had she worked for you?" Morrison asked, his tone gentle.

"Since mid-May. She answered an ad I put in the University of Oregon paper. I hire college kids every summer for housekeeping and front desk." Rita twisted her wedding ring. "Was it really an accident? The sheriff said she drowned."

"We're investigating all possibilities," Brennan said. "Can you tell us about Jennifer? What kind of employee was she?"

"Good. Reliable. The guests liked her, the other workers too. She wasn't cliquish or dramatic."

"Did she mention any problems? Anyone making her uncomfortable?"

Rita hesitated. "She said a couple of times she felt like people were watching her. Small-town weirdness, you know? The locals pay attention to seasonal workers."

"Did she name anyone specifically?" Brennan leaned forward slightly. "Anyone who paid too much attention?"

"No. And I asked, because I don't tolerate harassment of my employees. She just laughed it off, said it was probably her imagination."

Morrison sipped his coffee. "What about her social life? Did she go out much?"

"Beach bonfires mostly. The seasonal workers have this whole scene—they hang out at specific spots, surf, party. Jennifer was part of that group. She wasn't wild or anything, but she was having fun. That's what summer at the coast is supposed to be."

"Was there anyone she was seeing romantically?" Brennan asked.

"Not that she mentioned. I got the impression she was just enjoying being twenty-one and free." Rita's voice caught.

Morrison gave her a moment. "We'd like to talk to the other seasonal workers."

"They're in the common room for their break in about twenty minutes. I'll take you there."

---

The common room was converted storage space—concrete floor, folding chairs, card table, mini-fridge. Five young women were there when Rita led them in. They'd been laughing but went quiet when they saw Morrison and Brennan.

"These are the detectives investigating Jennifer's death," Rita said. "Please cooperate." She left.

The silence stretched. Brennan recognized the dynamic—authority meeting youth, law enforcement meeting people who probably had fake IDs. Morrison seemed to recognize it too.

"We're not here to cause problems," he said, pulling up a chair and sitting at their level instead of standing over them. "We're trying to understand what happened to Jennifer. You worked with her, hung out with her. Anything you can tell us helps."

A blonde girl with a deep tan spoke first. "We already told the sheriff it was an accident. Jennifer went to the caves sometimes. We all did."

"Alone?" Brennan asked.

"Sometimes. Usually in groups, but yeah, sometimes alone. The caves are pretty during low tide. You can find tide pools, shells, sea glass."

"Did Jennifer seem worried about anything?" Morrison asked. "Scared? Uncomfortable?"

The girls exchanged glances. Finally a red-haired girl named Christie spoke. "She said a couple of times that locals gave her weird vibes. Like they were judging us."

"Which locals?"

"In general. When we'd go to the tavern or surf shop, some older guys would watch us. Not hitting on us, just watching. Jenny said it made her feel unwelcome."

"The locals don't like us," another girl added. "They think we're invading their town. One old guy at the beach told us to 'respect the caves' like we were going to vandalize them."

Brennan felt her attention sharpen. "This old guy—what did he look like?"

"I don't know. Old. Maybe fifty? Work clothes, like a fisherman. He was walking past when we were heading toward the caves and he just stopped and stared and said we should respect them, that they were dangerous. Super intense about it."

"When was this?"

Christie shrugged. "Two weeks ago? Three?"

Morrison made notes. "Did Jennifer mention anyone specific? Someone who offered to show her the caves?"

The blonde girl nodded. "There was this one guy at the surf shop who kept asking which caves we'd been to, which ones were safe. Jenny thought he was flirting but he just kept talking about tides and safety protocols. She said he was obsessed with the caves."

"What did he look like?"

"Older, like forties. Weathered face. Wore a hat."

Brennan filed it away. "Did any of you go to the bonfire the night Jennifer died?"

Three of them had. They described a typical beach party—driftwood fire, beer, guitar music, maybe thirty people. Jennifer had been there until around ten, laughing and talking. She'd said she was going for a walk to clear her head.

"Did anyone follow her?"

"Not that we noticed. But it was dark. Someone could have."

After twenty more minutes Morrison thanked them and they left the common room. Rita was waiting by the office.

"Did that help?" she asked.

"Every bit helps," Morrison said. "Mrs. Sanderson, we'd like to see Jennifer's room."

Rita's face went carefully blank. "The sheriff already searched it."

"I'd like to see it myself," Brennan said.

Rita pulled keys from her pocket. "Room 14. I haven't cleaned it out yet. Couldn't bring myself to."

---

Room 14 was at the far end of the horseshoe, with ocean views. Rita unlocked the door and stood back. Morrison and Brennan went in alone.

The room was standard motel issue—double bed, dresser, small bathroom. But personalized: a University of Oregon banner on the wall, a radio on the nightstand, clothes draped over a chair. Someone's temporary life, suddenly frozen.

Brennan went through the dresser drawers while Morrison checked the bathroom. Clothes, mostly—shorts and t-shirts, swimsuits. A journal on the nightstand caught her eye.

"Morrison."

He came out. Brennan sat on the bed and opened the journal carefully. Entries typical for a college student—observations about the ocean, complaints about guests, excitement about parties.

She flipped through, scanning. June entries were enthusiastic. Early July shifted slightly.

Then she found it. An entry from July 3rd, two weeks before Jennifer's death:

*Weird day. That guy from the harbor—the one who volunteers for rescues—stopped by the motel asking if we'd been to the caves. Not chatty asking, intense asking. He wanted to know which ones, when we went, if we understood the tides. I said yes, we're careful, and he just stared at me with this look like I'd lied to him. Rita said he's well-respected, saves lives, but something about him knows the tides too well. Like he thinks about them all the time. Maybe I'm being paranoid. Beach party tomorrow—need to stop overthinking everything.*

Brennan read it twice, then handed the journal to Morrison. She watched his face shift from skepticism to concern.

"Someone who knows the tides," he said quietly.

"Too well. That's specific."

Morrison flipped back through. "She doesn't name him."

"But she identifies him. Harbor volunteer. Rescue services. Someone local with access to tide information who feels proprietary about the caves."

"That's half the fishermen in Depoe Bay."

"No. Half know the tides. But only someone obsessed would make her notice it. Someone who thinks about them all the time."

Morrison looked out the window, jaw tight. "We need to pull volunteer records from the harbormaster's office. Cross-reference with anyone who had contact with Torres and Chen."

"Quietly. If the killer realizes we're narrowing focus, he could destroy evidence."

"Or escalate." Morrison turned from the window. "Serial offenders don't usually stop voluntarily, right?"

"No. They stop when they're caught or when circumstances prevent them."

"Three years, three victims, one per summer. If the pattern holds—"

"Then he's already thinking about number four."

The room felt suddenly smaller. Somewhere out there, someone was watching seasonal workers, cataloging their movements, waiting for the right tide cycle.

Jennifer Kowalski had noticed him. She'd written about him two weeks before she died. She'd felt his attention and dismissed it as paranoia.

Brennan bagged the journal as evidence. "We need to show this to Garland. It establishes Jennifer felt threatened by a specific person. That contradicts the accidental drowning narrative."

"Garland's not going to like it."

"He'll have to accept it." Brennan looked around the room one more time. A girl who'd come for beach parties and summer wages and found a killer instead. "Jennifer identified him, Morrison. She gave us the clue. We just have to figure out who."

They locked the room and returned to Rita, who stood in the office doorway with arms wrapped around herself.

"Did you find anything?"

"We're making progress," Morrison said.

They left the Tidewater Motel as the sun touched the horizon, turning the ocean copper and gold. Tourist families walked past toward dinner, teenagers laughed on the beach trail, and somewhere in town, a killer who knew the tides too well went about his evening routine, invisible and patient.

Brennan held the journal like a promise. Jennifer Kowalski couldn't speak anymore, but her words could.
