# Chapter 8: Partnership Friction

The sun was dropping toward the horizon when Morrison suggested they drive the coast to survey the cave locations where Torres and Chen had been found. Brennan agreed immediately, pulling her briefcase from the borrowed office.

"We should document sight lines, accessibility, proximity to roads," she said, following him to the parking lot.

"Brennan." Morrison stopped at his pickup. "It's after six. Low tide was three hours ago. The caves are inaccessible."

"We can at least see the areas, get a sense of geography."

"In fading light with the tide coming in? That's how people get killed on this coast." He opened the driver's door. "We can drive past the locations. But we're not going down to any caves tonight."

Brennan felt frustration spike. "We're losing time. Every day—"

"Is a day we stay alive to catch this guy." Morrison's tone was patient but firm. "Get in. I'll show you the locations. But we do it my way, which means we don't take stupid risks with the ocean."

They drove north on Highway 101, the Pacific visible through gaps in coastal pine. The road hugged the cliffside, narrow and winding, with turnouts every half mile for tourists to photograph the view. Morrison drove with easy competence.

"Torres was found here," he said, pulling into a scenic overlook. Below, jagged black rocks met churning white water. A trail descended through shore pine, marked with a faded wooden sign warning about tide dangers.

Brennan got out, studying the location. "How far down to the cave?"

"Quarter mile. Steep terrain, loose rocks. At low tide you can reach the entrance, but you need to know exactly when to go in and when to get out. Tourists get trapped every summer because they don't check the tables."

"Could someone carry an unconscious person down that trail?"

Morrison considered. "Yeah, if they were strong enough and knew the terrain. But it'd be risky. Better to walk someone down conscious, maybe under the pretense of showing them something."

"Like a cave tour."

"Like a cave tour."

Brennan made notes, photographing the overlook and trail entrance from multiple angles. The isolation was striking—no houses visible, no other cars on this stretch of highway. In July 1976, Michelle Torres had walked down that trail and never come back up.

"Chen's location is five miles south," Morrison said. "We'll pass through town to get there."

They drove in silence for a few minutes, Brennan watching the coastline roll past. Then Morrison said, "You're pushing too hard."

"Three women are dead."

"And you can't help them by getting yourself killed rushing into caves at high tide."

"I'm not suggesting we rush into anything. I'm suggesting we move with appropriate urgency."

"There's urgency and there's recklessness." Morrison glanced at her. "You've been here two days. You've alienated the sheriff, annoyed the ME, and you're treating this like a case you can solve through pure determination and no sleep."

"I'm treating this like what it is—a serial murder investigation where the killer is still active."

"And I'm trying to help you catch him, which means not burning out in the first week." Morrison's voice stayed calm, steel underneath. "This is my coast, Brennan. I've worked here eight years. I've pulled bodies from those caves—drownings, suicides, accidents. I know the dangers. If you want to solve this case, you need to listen when I tell you something isn't safe."

Brennan felt her defensiveness rise. "I appreciate your local knowledge. But I'm the lead investigator, and I'll determine the investigation pace."

"Fine. You're the lead. But when I say we can't access a cave because the tide's wrong, that's not questioning your authority. That's keeping us both alive."

They passed through Depoe Bay, the evening crowd filling restaurants and bars. The normalcy felt surreal against the tension in the truck cab.

Morrison pulled into another overlook south of town. "Chen was found down there. Different cave system, different access point, but same setup—isolated, tide-dependent, requires local knowledge."

Brennan got out without responding, walking to the edge. The sun was lower now, painting the ocean copper and gold. Below, waves crashed against basalt formations that had stood for millennia. Beautiful and deadly.

Morrison came to stand beside her, maintaining professional distance. "You said this is your first field lead."

It wasn't a question, but Brennan answered. "Yes."

"How long with the BSU?"

"Three years. Desk analysis, pattern recognition, profile development. I requested field assignment six months ago."

"And they sent you here."

"They sent me where a pattern needed recognition." Brennan looked at him. "You think I'm not qualified."

"I think you're brilliant at seeing patterns. You connected three cases we ruled accidents for three years. That's impressive. But being brilliant at analysis and being good at field investigation are different skills." Morrison paused. "And I think you're trying so hard to prove yourself that you're not listening to people who can help you."

The words stung because they were true. Brennan had spent three years fighting to be taken seriously in the BSU, the only woman in a unit that didn't quite know what to do with her. She'd proven herself through work—countless hours analyzing cases, building profiles, seeing connections no one else saw.

She needed this case. Not just to stop a killer, but to prove she belonged in the field, not behind a desk.

"I'm listening," she said finally. "I'm just not used to waiting for tides and terrain and local protocols."

"That's fair." Morrison looked out at the ocean. "But this investigation isn't happening in Quantico. It's happening on the Oregon coast in 1978. We don't have computers or instant communication. We have file boxes and rotary phones and tide tables. And we have about a month left of summer before seasonal workers leave and we lose access to witnesses and the killer goes dormant."

"Which is why we need to move fast."

"Fast and smart. Not fast and reckless." Morrison turned to her. "You want to know why I've been helping you? Not because Garland ordered it—he'd prefer I obstruct you. Because when you showed me the pattern, I saw it. I saw three women I helped declare accidents, and I realized I'd been wrong. I've carried those cases for years. Now I know I should have wondered harder."

The vulnerability in his voice was unexpected. Brennan saw the weight he carried—eight years of coastal deaths, all heavy.

"I didn't listen when Pete Reyes said Chen's position looked wrong," Morrison continued. "I didn't push back when Garland wanted it closed fast. I accepted the easy answer. So yeah, I want to catch this guy. Not just because he killed three women. Because I helped him by being too willing to call it accident."

"That's not—"

"It is. I know it is. And I'm not going to make that mistake again." Morrison pulled a folded chart from his truck bed, spreading it on the hood. "This is a tide table for the next two weeks. Tomorrow morning, low tide is at six-forty. We'll have about ninety minutes to access and document the Kowalski cave before water makes it dangerous. The Torres and Chen caves have different accessibility windows—we'll need to check them on separate days based on tide cycles."

Brennan studied the chart. The columns of numbers and times were a language she didn't speak, but Morrison explained—tide heights, timing, moon phases, how the Pacific's patterns dictated everything.

"The killer knows this," she said. "Positioning bodies in caves requires knowing exactly when he has access, when low tide gives him time to stage."

"Which means he studies these tables. Plans around them." Morrison refolded the chart. "The harbormaster's office keeps logs of who requests tide information. It's not proof, but it's another data point."

"Maritime knowledge, cave familiarity, access to seasonal workers, obsessive tide focus." Brennan counted on her fingers. "We're building a profile."

"And we've got a name that keeps appearing. Leonard Pruitt."

The sun touched the horizon, turning the sky orange and purple. Tourist traffic on 101 was thinning as people headed to dinner. Morrison and Brennan stood at the overlook, the partnership that had been forced and awkward slowly becoming something functional.

"Tomorrow morning," Morrison said. "Six AM. We examine the Kowalski cave properly, document everything, look for anything we missed. Then we cross-reference maritime volunteer records and identify everyone who had access to all three cave locations during all three murder windows."

"And we interview Leonard Pruitt."

"Carefully. If he's our guy, we can't spook him. If he's not, we can't poison the investigation by harassing a respected community member."

Brennan nodded. The frustration she'd felt earlier had tempered into something more productive. Morrison was right—she'd been pushing for action without considering the constraints they operated under. But he was also listening to her analysis, accepting her expertise, working with her instead of against her.

"I'm sorry," she said. "For being difficult about the tide timing. You're right that I don't know this environment. I should listen more."

Morrison almost smiled. "You're not difficult. You're driven. There's a difference." He gathered the tide chart. "But maybe trust that I'm driven too. Just in a different way."

They drove back to Depoe Bay as the last light faded from the sky. The ocean disappeared into darkness, marked only by the sound of waves and the occasional flash of white foam. Somewhere out there, in caves that would be accessible again at tomorrow's low tide, evidence waited.

And somewhere in town, Leonard Pruitt—or whoever knew the tides too well—was going about his evening, confident that three years of perfect murders had taught him he was untouchable.

Morrison dropped Brennan at the Fisherman's Rest. "Six AM. Bring warm clothes and waterproof boots if you have them. It's cold in those caves."

"I'll be ready."

"I know you will." He put the truck in gear. "Get some sleep, Brennan. We're going to need it."

She watched him drive away, then walked into the motel. The partnership was working better now, built on honest friction instead of forced politeness. They understood each other's pressures, respected each other's expertise.

Tomorrow they'd go back into the caves. Tomorrow they'd look for the evidence that would break the pattern.

Tonight, she'd study tide tables and maritime records and prepare to hunt a killer who thought he'd mastered the ocean's rhythms.

But Brennan was learning those rhythms too. And she was very good at seeing patterns.

Even the ones killers thought they'd hidden beneath the waves.
