# Chapter 6: The First Postcard

The call came at nine-fifteen the next morning while Brennan reviewed her notes from the archive work. Morrison picked up, listened for thirty seconds, then covered the mouthpiece.

"Tom Weaver from the Beacon. Says he received something strange in today's mail. Wants us to take a look."

"Strange how?"

"Wouldn't say over the phone."

The Depoe Bay Beacon occupied a storefront on Highway 101 between a tackle shop and a saltwater taffy store. Weekly newspaper, four pages off-season and eight during summer, covering local news, tide tables, and fishing reports. Homespun community journalism with no pretensions.

Tom Weaver was waiting in the cramped office that served as newsroom, darkroom, and headquarters. Fifties, ink-stained fingers, reading glasses pushed up on his forehead.

"Detective Morrison. Thanks for coming." He shook their hands. "Tom Weaver. My wife Jean and I run the Beacon. Usually our mail is letters about potholes or someone's garden. This morning we got... well, you should see it."

He led them to a desk covered in layout boards. A postcard lay in the center, isolated like a quarantine case.

Brennan pulled on latex gloves before picking it up. Morrison leaned in to read over her shoulder.

The postcard was vintage, probably 1950s or early 1960s. The front showed sun-faded Oregon coast at sunset—dramatic basalt rocks, crashing waves. Picture-postcard scene tourists bought as souvenirs. Washed-out colors of old printing.

The back mattered.

The message was typed on a manual typewriter, letters slightly uneven. The 'e' was visibly misaligned, sitting higher than other letters. The text read:

*The sea remembers what the town forgets. Three returned, more will follow. Watch the tides.*

No signature. No return address. The postmark was local—Depoe Bay, two days earlier. Addressee simply "Depoe Bay Beacon, Highway 101, Depoe Bay, OR."

Brennan read it three times, pulse quickening. "Have you shown this to anyone else?"

"Just Jean. She opened it this morning. I called Sheriff Garland's office first, but they said he was in a meeting and to contact you."

"Good." Brennan turned the postcard over, examining the front again. "Mr. Weaver, I need you not to mention this to anyone. Not other residents, not in the newspaper. This is evidence in an active investigation."

Weaver's expression shifted from concerned to alarmed. "Evidence of what?"

"I can't discuss details," Brennan said. "But this postcard is extremely significant. We'll need to take it for analysis."

"It's not a joke? Some kid playing around?"

"No." Morrison's tone was flat. "It's not a joke."

Weaver looked between them, reading their faces. "This is about those girls, isn't it? The drownings. You think someone—" He stopped, the implication too large to voice.

"Do you have the envelope it came in?"

"Yeah." Weaver retrieved a standard business envelope from the trash, also hand-addressed in typewriter text. Same misaligned 'e'. Same local postmark.

Brennan bagged both items in evidence bags, documenting chain of custody on the labels. Morrison photographed from multiple angles while evidence was still on Weaver's desk.

"You said you called the sheriff?" Morrison asked.

"Twenty minutes ago. Dispatcher said Garland was meeting with town council and couldn't be disturbed, to contact state police." Weaver paused. "Is that weird?"

Morrison didn't answer directly. "We'll handle it from here. Don't mention this to anyone. If people ask, say it was a prank and we took care of it."

"But if there's a danger—"

"There's an investigation," Brennan said. "We need to control information flow. Publicizing this could interfere with identifying who sent it."

Weaver nodded slowly, troubled. "My family's run this paper for forty years. Fires, storms, accidents. But this... it feels different."

"It is different," Morrison said. "Which is why we need your cooperation."

They left the Beacon and walked to Morrison's pickup, evidence bags in Brennan's briefcase. The morning was overcast, fog lingering along the coastline.

"Zodiac," Morrison said once they were in the vehicle.

"Yes." Brennan made notes on her legal pad. "The format, the tone, the cryptic phrasing. He's following that template—communication with authority, threatening future crimes, creating fear."

"'Three returned.'" Morrison started the engine. "Direct reference to our three victims."

"He's announcing himself. Claiming credit. The killer has been invisible for three years, but now he wants recognition." Brennan studied her notes. "This changes the profile. Most serial offenders don't communicate. When they do, it suggests psychological needs—attention, control, demonstrating superiority."

"Or he's escalating."

"Yes. Communication is often escalation. He's not satisfied with the crimes themselves. He wants the investigation to know. He wants the community to know."

Morrison drove toward the courthouse, jaw tight. "Garland's not going to want this public."

"Garland doesn't have a choice. This is evidence in a serial murder investigation. It goes to the FBI lab for analysis—typewriter identification, paper dating, fingerprints if we're lucky."

"Which means mailing it to Quantico and waiting days."

"Correct."

Morrison pulled into the courthouse lot but didn't get out. "You realize what this does? Once we log this as evidence, request lab analysis, we're officially investigating serial murder. Garland can't suppress it. The cat's out of the bag."

"Good." Brennan met his eyes. "Three women are dead. The killer is taunting us. No more room for covering this up to protect tourist season."

They found Garland in his office, looking through budget reports. His expression darkened when he saw them.

"This better be important. Town council is breathing down my neck about overtime costs."

"We received evidence from the Beacon this morning," Brennan said, setting her briefcase on his desk. "A postcard sent to the newspaper with a message referencing multiple deaths. Communication from the person responsible for the drownings."

Garland went very still. "What?"

Brennan removed the evidence bag, laying it on the desk where Garland could read through the plastic.

He read it twice. Then looked up, face flushed. "Who else has seen this?"

"Tom Weaver and his wife Jean. Detective Morrison and myself. No one else."

"Weaver's going to print this."

"No. I instructed him to maintain silence. This is evidence in an active investigation."

"You instructed him." Garland's tone was dangerous. "In my jurisdiction."

"In a federal investigation," Brennan corrected. "Sheriff, this confirms what I've been telling you. The drownings weren't accidents. Someone killed those women and is now communicating. 'Three returned' matches our three victims exactly. This goes to the FBI lab for analysis."

"Analysis that puts in black and white that we've got a serial killer in Depoe Bay." Garland stood, pacing. "Do you understand what that does to this town? It's not just tourism. It's property values, business investment, people's livelihoods. Towns don't recover from this kind of publicity."

"Towns also don't recover from serial killers who keep operating because law enforcement was more concerned with public relations than public safety."

Garland's face darkened. "That's not fair."

"Three women are dead. A fourth message promises 'more will follow.' Fair doesn't enter into it."

Morrison stepped between them. "Sheriff, Agent Brennan's right this needs to go to the lab. But we can control information release. Lab analysis is confidential. As long as Weaver keeps quiet and we don't announce anything publicly, the investigation continues without creating panic."

Garland looked at Morrison like a man searching for a life raft. "Can we keep this quiet?"

"For now. But if the sender contacts media again, we lose control. We need to move fast on identification."

Garland sat heavily. "Fine. Send it to your lab. But I want regular updates, and I want veto power over any public statements."

"You'll get updates," Brennan said. "But I won't give you veto power over investigative decisions. This is a federal case now. The postcard makes it undeniable."

Silence stretched. Finally Garland waved dismissal. "Get out. Both of you. And Morrison—remember who signs your evaluation reports."

They left, Brennan's briefcase feeling heavier. In the hallway, Morrison stopped.

"You just made an enemy of the sheriff."

"He was already an enemy. Now he's an enemy who can't pretend this isn't happening."

Morrison almost smiled. "Fair point. Let's get that postcard packaged and documented. The sooner it's at the lab, the sooner we have analysis."

They spent the next hour in Brennan's office, photographing the postcard from every angle, documenting every detail, preparing it for shipment to the FBI lab. The typewriter's misaligned 'e' was consistent. The paper stock was vintage, meaning the killer either had old postcards saved or bought them from antique shops. The message was carefully constructed—not random ravings but calculated communication.

"'The sea remembers what the town forgets,'" Morrison read aloud. "Almost poetic."

"He views himself as an agent of memory or justice. The sea as arbiter. The town as willfully ignorant." Brennan sealed the package. "This isn't random violence. This is someone with a philosophy, a framework for why he does this."

"Which makes him more dangerous."

"Yes. Because he believes he's right."

Brennan addressed the package to the FBI lab, filled out requisition forms in triplicate. Morrison drove it to the post office for registered mail. Three to five days for delivery, then analysis, then results. In 1978 law enforcement, that was fast. It still felt painfully slow.

When Morrison returned, Brennan stood at her window, looking out at Depoe Bay—ocean beyond the highway, tourists walking past oblivious, the killer somewhere among them.

"More will follow," she said quietly. "That's a promise. He's not done. And now he's communicating, which means his confidence is increasing."

"We'll catch him," Morrison said.

"Before number four?"

Morrison didn't answer. They both knew the truth. The killer had three years of practice staying invisible. Now he was reaching out, taunting them, confident enough to announce his existence.

The race was on. And they were already behind.
