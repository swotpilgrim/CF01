# Chapter 1: Low Tide Discovery

The fog came in thick off the Pacific, reducing Highway 101 to gray asphalt and guardrails. Sarah Brennan drove carefully, her Bureau-issue Plymouth handling the curves with deliberate weight. Every few miles the fog would thin to reveal glimpses of coastline below—black rocks, white surf, Sitka spruce clinging to headlands.

She'd been driving since dawn from Portland, three hours with the case file in her briefcase. *Depoe Bay Sheriff's Office requesting FBI consultation on suspicious death. Female victim, coastal location, possible drowning.* The request sounded routine, but Brennan had pulled the archived reports before leaving Quantico. Three summers, three young women, three sea caves. The local authorities called them accidents. She knew better.

Depoe Bay materialized as the fog lifted—a handful of blocks clustered around the world's smallest harbor, fishing boats crowding a channel barely wide enough to navigate. Motels lined the highway, their neon signs advertising VACANCY and OCEAN VIEW. Tourist season was in full swing, families and college kids drawn to the Oregon coast for cheap accommodation and moody beauty.

Brennan followed directions to a turnout north of town where three vehicles were parked: a sheriff's cruiser, an unmarked Ford pickup, a county van. She pulled in and killed the engine. The sound of surf was immediate and overwhelming.

A uniformed deputy leaned against the cruiser. He looked up as Brennan got out, his expression shifting from boredom to dismissal. She was used to that look. Twenty-eight, five-foot-four in low heels, dark hair pulled back in a practical bun. Her navy pantsuit marked her as Bureau before she opened her mouth.

"FBI," she said, showing her credentials. "Where's the scene?"

The deputy jerked his thumb toward a trail descending through shore pine. "Down there. Sheriff's waiting. So's the state guy."

Brennan grabbed her briefcase and camera bag from the trunk. The trail was steep and rocky, roots crossing like tripwires. Fifty yards down, it opened onto a rocky beach where two men stood near the waterline, looking toward a dark opening in the basalt cliff face.

The older man wore a sheriff's uniform stretched tight across his middle. He turned as Brennan approached, face already defensive. "You're the FBI?"

"Special Agent Sarah Brennan, Behavioral Science Unit." She extended her hand. He shook it briefly.

"Roy Garland, county sheriff. This is Detective Jack Morrison, Oregon State Police."

Morrison was tall and rangy, mid-thirties, wearing jeans and a work shirt rather than a suit. His handshake was firmer, gray-blue eyes assessing. "Agent Brennan."

"Detective." She looked toward the cave entrance. "The victim's inside?"

"What's left of the tide window," Morrison said. "We've got maybe forty minutes before the water comes back in." His voice had the flat vowels of the Pacific Northwest, calm and matter-of-fact.

Garland folded his arms. "Before we go down there, let's be clear. This is a drowning. Accidental. Young woman went exploring at night, got caught by the tide, hit her head on the rocks. Tragic, but it happens. I called state police for technical support, not to turn this into a federal investigation."

Brennan met his eyes. "My office received a request for pattern analysis consultation."

"That wasn't my request."

"Nevertheless." She turned to Morrison. "Show me the scene."

Morrison glanced at Garland, who scowled but didn't object. "This way. Watch your footing—the rocks are slick."

The cave entrance was a jagged crack in the cliff, wide enough for two people. Inside, the temperature dropped ten degrees and the ocean sound became a deep resonance that vibrated in the chest. Morrison's flashlight beam cut through darkness, reflecting off wet basalt walls glistening black and green with algae.

"Low tide was at six this morning," Morrison said, his voice echoing. "Couple of tourists found her around seven, called it in. By the time we got here, tide was already coming back. We documented what we could and moved the body to the county morgue."

"Moved?" Brennan felt a spike of frustration. "The scene's been compromised?"

"The scene was about to be underwater." Morrison's tone was patient. "Ocean doesn't care about evidence preservation."

He was right. Brennan had spent three years analyzing cases from a desk in Quantico; this was her first field lead. The Pacific Ocean was already teaching her about operational reality. "Show me where she was positioned."

The cave opened into a chamber about thirty feet across, ceiling lost in darkness. Tide pools dotted the uneven floor, the smell of seaweed and salt overwhelming. Morrison led her to the far wall where yellow plastic evidence markers looked absurdly bright against black rock.

"She was here," Morrison said, indicating an area near the wall. "On her back, arms extended forward." He demonstrated, arms reaching out. "Like this."

Brennan knelt, careful not to disturb the markers. She pulled out her camera and photographed the markers from multiple angles. The flash bounced off wet walls.

"You said arms extended forward," she said. "Toward the wall specifically?"

"Yeah. Both arms. Hands were about here." Morrison indicated a point on the basalt wall about three feet from the floor.

Brennan shifted her position, bringing the flashlight beam to bear on the wall section where the victim's hands had reached. The basalt was covered in algae and mineral deposits, but there was something else—linear marks, deliberate cuts in the stone.

"Do you see this?" She traced the air above the marks without touching them.

Morrison leaned in. "Scratches?"

"Carvings." Brennan took close-up photographs. The marks formed a pattern—crude symbols like a combination of letters and geometric shapes. They'd been cut into the stone with a sharp tool, edges still fresh, not worn smooth by tidal action.

"Could be old graffiti," Morrison said. "These caves were used for smuggling during Prohibition. Lot of history here."

"The cuts are recent. Look at the edges—sharp, not eroded. And the victim's position..." Brennan stood, looking down at the evidence markers. "On her back, arms extended, hands reaching toward these specific marks. That's not how someone falls. That's staging."

Morrison was quiet, expression unreadable. "Dr. Webb did the preliminary exam. Seawater in her lungs, blunt force trauma to the skull. Consistent with hitting the rocks, then drowning as the tide came in."

"Was there blood at the scene? Any indication she was struck here?"

"No. But the tide would wash it away."

"I understand." Brennan photographed the symbols from several more angles. "What do you know about the victim?"

"Jennifer Kowalski, twenty-one, University of Oregon student. She was working at the Tidewater Motel for the summer, housekeeping. Last seen around ten last night leaving a beach bonfire."

"Alone?"

"According to witnesses, yes."

Brennan lowered the camera. "Detective Morrison, has anyone examined this cave for previous incidents?"

"Previous?"

"Other deaths. Bodies found in similar circumstances."

Morrison's eyes narrowed. "This is the first body I've recovered from this specific cave. But drownings happen on this coast. People don't respect the water."

"I'd like to review any coastal death reports from the past five years. Particularly those involving sea caves and female victims."

"That's—" Morrison stopped, glancing toward the cave entrance where Garland stood silhouetted against the gray morning light. "That's a lot of files."

"I'll need access."

A wave surged into the chamber, pooling around their feet ankle-deep and cold. Morrison checked his watch. "We need to go. Tide's turning."

Brennan took three more photographs, then reluctantly followed Morrison back toward the entrance. The water was rising fast, each wave pushing deeper. By the time they reached the rocky beach, water was flowing steadily through the entrance like a river in reverse.

Garland was waiting, his face flushed. "Get what you needed?"

"For now." Brennan set her camera bag on a dry rock. "I'll need to come back at the next low tide for a more thorough examination."

"That's not necessary—"

"Sheriff Garland." Brennan kept her voice level and professional. "The victim's position and the carved symbols on the cave wall suggest this wasn't an accidental drowning. I'm opening a preliminary investigation, which means this is an active crime scene. I'll need it secured and I'll need access to your files."

Garland's jaw tightened. "You're making a lot of assumptions based on some scratches in a cave wall."

"I'm following evidence where it leads."

"This is my jurisdiction."

"And I'm here at your department's request." Brennan picked up her bags. "I'll need an office space to work from and Detective Morrison's assistance as state liaison. We should brief together after the autopsy is finalized."

She started up the trail before Garland could respond, heart pounding harder than the climb required. Her first field command, and she'd just overridden a sitting sheriff in his jurisdiction. Technically she had the authority. Practically, she'd just made an enemy.

Morrison caught up halfway to the parking area. "That could have gone better."

"He's already decided this is accidental."

"Tourist season. A murder investigation would hurt business."

"Three people are dead. That should hurt more."

Morrison slowed, his hand on a tree trunk. "Three?"

Brennan stopped. "Summer of 1976, Michelle Torres, nineteen, found in a sea cave north of here. Summer of 1977, Amanda Chen, twenty-two, found in a different cave. Both ruled accidental drownings. Both college students working seasonal jobs. Both found at low tide."

Morrison's expression shifted—not quite belief, but the first crack in skepticism. "You think this is a pattern."

"I know it is. The question is whether anyone here wants to see it."

They reached the parking area where the deputy still leaned against his cruiser. Morrison walked to his pickup, looking out at the ocean where fog was rolling back in. When he turned back, his face was neutral.

"Courthouse annex has an empty office. I'll get you keys." He paused. "And I'll pull those files you wanted."

"Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. If you're wrong about this, you'll have stirred up trouble for nothing."

"I'm not wrong."

Morrison studied her for a long moment. Finally he nodded. "Low tide tomorrow is at six-forty. I'll pick you up at six if you want to examine that cave properly."

"I'll be ready."

"Get a room at the Fisherman's Rest. It's clean and the owner minds his business." He climbed into his pickup, then leaned out the window. "Welcome to Depoe Bay, Agent Brennan. Hope you're right about this, because if you are, we've got a serious problem."

Brennan watched him drive away, followed by Garland's cruiser and the county van. She stood alone with fog swirling around her ankles and the sound of the Pacific battering rocks below.

Three women dead over three years, their bodies arranged like offerings in sea caves while everyone called it accident.

She wasn't wrong about patterns. She just had to prove it before the killer claimed a fourth victim.
