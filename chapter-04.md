# Chapter 4: Symbol Recognition

The borrowed office in the courthouse annex was barely large enough for a desk, two chairs, and a filing cabinet that wouldn't close. The overhead fluorescent light flickered whenever a truck passed on Highway 101. Brennan had been there since seven, spreading crime scene photographs across every available surface.

Morrison arrived at eight-thirty with two paper bags that smelled of fried fish and vinegar. "You eat yet?"

"No." Brennan didn't look up from the photograph she was examining with a magnifying glass.

"Figured." He cleared space and unpacked containers—fish and chips from the wharf. "If you're going to work late, you might as well eat something that isn't courthouse coffee."

Brennan accepted a fork. The fish was good, crispy and hot, and she realized she'd skipped lunch. Morrison ate standing, looking at the photographs she'd arranged on the wall.

"You're mapping the symbols," he said.

"Documenting them. Look." She stood beside him, pointing to three enlarged photographs. "These are close-ups from the Kowalski scene. The marks are carved with a thin blade or awl, not scratched by rocks. See how the depth is consistent? That takes control and intention."

Morrison leaned closer. The symbols were crude but not random—angular lines arranged in groups of three or four. "What do they mean?"

"I don't know yet. They're not any alphabet I recognize. Not English, Nordic runes, maritime flags. Someone invented their own system."

"Or copied from folklore. These caves have history."

Brennan shook her head. "The cuts are fresh. Made within weeks, maybe days. Compare them to this." She pulled over another photograph showing weathered graffiti. "This is real historical marking—edges worn smooth, algae filling the cuts. The symbols near Kowalski's body are nothing like that."

Morrison studied both photos. Brennan pulled out a legal pad where she'd been sketching the symbols. "There are six distinct marks. They appear in different combinations, but these six forms repeat."

She showed him her sketches—angular symbols like combinations of V, K, and T, mixed with wave-like marks or crossed lines. Morrison sat in the other chair.

"Tell me about signature behavior," he said. "You mentioned it at the diner. How does this work?"

Brennan set down her pencil, grateful that he was engaging seriously rather than dismissing her analysis. "In the Behavioral Science Unit, we distinguish between MO and signature. MO is method of operation—the practical steps an offender takes to commit the crime. That can evolve, become more sophisticated as they learn. Signature is psychological—the elements that fulfill the emotional need driving the crime. Signature is stable. It's why they do what they do, not just how."

"And you think these symbols are signature."

"Yes. The killer doesn't need them to commit murder. They don't help him avoid detection—they increase risk because they take time. But he does it anyway because it fulfills something. The symbols mean something. They're part of his fantasy, his ritual."

Morrison picked up one of her sketches. "So what does it mean that he poses the victims reaching toward them?"

"Presentation. Offering. He's creating a scene that matters to him. The victims interact with the symbols, like petitioners at an altar." Brennan paused. "This is someone with organized, ritualistic psychology. He plans. He selects locations. He has time and privacy to arrange everything. That suggests intelligence, patience, and access."

"Access to the caves."

"And to the victims. He's watching them, selecting them. He knows their routines well enough to isolate them."

Morrison was quiet, staring at the photographs. The fluorescent light flickered, casting shadows across the cave images. "I want you to be wrong about this," he said finally. "I want this to be accidental drowning. What you're describing is worse."

"I know."

"But you're not wrong."

"No."

He rubbed his face. "How do you do this? Spend your days thinking about the worst things people do?"

"Someone has to think about it. Otherwise they just keep doing it."

Morrison nodded slowly. "Fair enough." He walked back to the wall of photographs. "What about geographic profiling?"

"That's about analyzing the spatial pattern of crimes to identify the offender's likely base of operations. Where they live, work, feel comfortable. Serial offenders usually commit crimes in areas they know—their comfort zone."

"Three cave locations spread over ten miles of coastline. What does that tell you?"

Brennan pulled out a local map marked with crime scene locations. "Torres was found here, north of town. Chen five miles south. Kowalski north again. Different caves, but all accessible at low tide, all require local knowledge, all isolated."

"So he knows the coast thoroughly."

"Intimately. He's comfortable with caves, tide schedules, difficult terrain. That suggests professional maritime experience or a lifetime of local familiarity."

"Or both."

"Or both."

Morrison traced the map with his finger. "The harbormaster's office keeps tide tables going back years. Anyone can access them, but the people who study them seriously are fishermen, rescue volunteers, Coast Guard. People whose lives depend on understanding tidal patterns."

"Like the person Jennifer Kowalski wrote about. Someone who 'knows the tides too well.'"

"Yeah." Morrison moved to the window, looking out at the parking lot. Beyond, Depoe Bay was settling into evening. "You know what bugs me most? If you're right, and I think you are, this person has been part of this community for years. Maybe their whole life. People know him, trust him. And he's been killing seasonal workers one summer at a time, hiding behind accidental drownings."

"That's usually how it works. Serial offenders aren't monsters. They're neighbors, coworkers, the helpful volunteer. That's how they avoid detection."

Morrison turned from the window. "How do you say Oregon?"

Brennan blinked. "What?"

"Oregon. How do you pronounce it?"

She hesitated. "Or-eh-gone?"

"Ory-gun. Like 'gun' not 'gone.' It's how locals say it."

"Ory-gun," Brennan repeated. "Thank you."

"Just figured if you're interviewing people here, might as well sound less like FBI from back east."

Brennan felt something shift—a small breach in professional distance. "What else am I getting wrong?"

Morrison almost smiled. "Besides assuming everyone wants a serial killer investigation disrupting their tourist season?"

"Besides that."

"You're doing fine. You're intense and you don't suffer fools, but you're not wrong. That counts for something." He checked his watch. "It's after nine. What else do you need tonight?"

"I want to review the archived files Dr. Webb is pulling for Torres and Chen. If the symbols appear in those crime scenes, it confirms the pattern."

"Those won't be ready until tomorrow. Webb said his assistant would have them by morning." Morrison started gathering the empty food containers. "Which means you should get some sleep. We start again at six if you still want to examine that cave at low tide."

Brennan did want to sleep, but her mind was racing with connections and questions. Still, Morrison was right—exhaustion helped no one. "Six works."

"I'll pick you up at the Fisherman's Rest."

After Morrison left, Brennan stayed another hour, photographing her sketches and organizing the visual evidence. The courthouse was silent except for the fluorescent hum and occasional footsteps from the night janitor.

She was filing photographs when she noticed something. One image Morrison had pulled from archived incident reports showed Amanda Chen's recovery scene in 1977. The photograph was grainy, taken with an older camera, mostly showing Chen's position.

But there, visible in the background along the cave wall, was a mark. Barely in frame, slightly out of focus, but unmistakable once Brennan knew what she was looking for.

She grabbed her magnifying glass. The angle was wrong, the focus soft, but she could make out carved lines in the basalt. Angular shapes. The same symbols.

"Got you," she said quietly.

The killer hadn't started with Jennifer Kowalski. He'd been doing this for at least three years, creating ritual cave scenes with victims and symbols and tide table precision. Invisible because everyone believed the simplest explanation.

Brennan placed the photograph in an evidence folder. Tomorrow she'd need the formal case files with better images, but this was enough. This proved pattern.

She locked the office and walked into the cool July night. The fog was rolling in from the ocean, swallowing streetlights. Somewhere in that fog, in one of Depoe Bay's houses or boats, a killer was going about his evening routine. Making dinner, watching television, whatever normal people did.

But part of him was thinking about the caves. About the tides. About the seasonal workers who'd be here for two more months of summer.

Brennan drove slowly to the Fisherman's Rest, windshield wipers clearing fog-dampness. In her briefcase was proof that Jennifer Kowalski's death was part of something larger and darker.

Now she had to convince a town that didn't want to see it, and catch a killer who'd perfected hiding in plain sight.

By morning, the tide would turn and the caves would be accessible. Brennan intended to find every symbol, document them, decode them if possible.

Symbols were language. Language meant meaning. And meaning was the key to understanding who created it, and why.
