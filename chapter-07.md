# Chapter 7: Surf Community

The afternoon sun had burned through the morning fog by the time Brennan and Morrison started their interviews along the beachfront. Highway 101 was busy with tourist traffic, families returning from tidepooling expeditions, surfers with boards strapped to station wagon roofs. The July crowds were at their peak, oblivious to the investigation unfolding around them.

First stop was Vickers' Surf Shop, a weathered storefront with hand-painted waves decorating the exterior and racks of surfboards visible through salt-filmed windows. A bell jangled as they entered. The smell of wax and neoprene filled the air, mixed with incense from a stick burning near the cash register.

Tommy Vickers looked up from organizing wetsuit rentals. He was early forties, tan and fit with sun-bleached hair, wearing board shorts and a faded t-shirt advertising some surf competition from years past. His smile was immediate and professional.

"Afternoon. Can I help you folks with gear?"

Morrison showed his badge. "Detective Morrison, state police. This is Agent Brennan with the FBI. We'd like to ask you some questions about the sea caves along this stretch of coast."

The smile didn't falter, but Brennan saw something shift behind Vickers' eyes. Calculation, maybe. Or caution. "Sure, happy to help. What do you need to know?"

"You're familiar with the cave systems?" Brennan asked.

"Yeah, I've been surfing and diving this coast for twenty years. Did four years with the Coast Guard before I opened the shop. I know the caves pretty well." He leaned against the counter, relaxed. "Is this about that girl who drowned last week? Jennifer something?"

"Jennifer Kowalski," Morrison said. "Did you know her?"

"She came in once or twice buying sunscreen or asking about surf lessons. Sweet kid. Real shame what happened." Vickers shook his head. "The caves are dangerous, especially if you don't understand the tides. I try to warn people, but tourists think they know better."

"Do you take people on cave tours?" Brennan asked.

"Sometimes. Usually locals who want to show visiting family, or photographers looking for good shots. I won't take anyone who doesn't follow safety protocols. I've done too many body recoveries with the Coast Guard to mess around."

Morrison made notes. "These seasonal workers—the college kids who come for summer jobs—do they ask you about caves?"

"All the time. They want to know the cool spots, the secret beaches. I give them the same warning I give everyone: never go alone, always check tide tables, and if something feels wrong, get out." He gestured to a chart on the wall showing local tide cycles. "That's free for anyone to look at. Most people don't bother."

"Did Jennifer Kowalski ask you about caves?" Brennan pressed.

Vickers thought for a moment. "Maybe? I get a lot of seasonal workers in here. They blend together after a while. But I remember giving my safety speech to a group of young women a few weeks back. She could have been one of them."

"That safety speech," Morrison said. "What exactly do you tell people?"

"Don't go at high tide. Don't turn your back on the ocean. Bring flashlights. Tell someone where you're going. Basic stuff that should be common sense but isn't." Vickers straightened, suddenly more serious. "Look, are you saying Jennifer's death wasn't accidental?"

"We're investigating all possibilities," Brennan said carefully. "Your Coast Guard service—did that include maritime rescue operations?"

"Yeah, four years stationed out of Newport. Lot of rescue calls, lot of body recoveries. It's why I'm so careful now about warning people." He pulled a card from behind the counter and handed it to Morrison. "I still volunteer with the county rescue unit. If you need someone who knows these caves, I'm happy to help."

They left the surf shop with Vickers' contact information and an impression of someone almost too helpful. In Morrison's pickup, Brennan voiced what they were both thinking.

"He fits the profile. Maritime knowledge, cave familiarity, Coast Guard background, access to seasonal workers through the shop."

"Yeah." Morrison pulled into traffic. "But so do about fifty other people in this town. And his eagerness to help could be genuine. Not everyone who offers assistance is a suspect."

"Or he's demonstrating he has nothing to hide."

"That too."

The main beach had a lifeguard station—a wooden tower that looked original to the 1950s, weathered by decades of salt and sun. Two lifeguards were on duty, both young men in their twenties with the bronze tans and athletic builds of people who lived in the ocean.

They were less enthusiastic than Vickers about talking to law enforcement.

"We already told the sheriff everything we know about the drowning," the taller one said. His name tag read BRENDAN. "College girl went into a cave at night without checking tides. Happens every summer. People don't respect the ocean."

"Did you ever talk to Jennifer Kowalski?" Brennan asked.

"Maybe. I don't know names. We warn people all day every day about rip currents and sneaker waves. Most don't listen."

The second lifeguard, KYLE according to his tag, was more blunt. "The seasonal workers are the worst. They come here from California or wherever, think they know beach safety because they went to the ocean once as kids. They get drunk at bonfires, wander off, do stupid shit. Then we're the ones who have to recover the bodies."

"Did either of you notice anyone paying particular attention to the seasonal workers?" Morrison asked. "Maybe offering to show them around, asking about their activities?"

Brendan and Kyle exchanged glances. Kyle answered, voice edged with hostility. "You mean like old dudes creeping on college girls? We'd notice that. But mostly the seasonal workers keep to themselves, party with each other. The locals leave them alone."

"What about you?" Brennan asked. "Do you interact with them?"

"We do our jobs." Brendan's tone was defensive. "We watch the water, we make rescues, we give safety warnings. We don't socialize with tourists."

The hostility was palpable, and Brennan felt it directed specifically at her. Morrison seemed to sense it too. "Thanks for your time. If you remember anything specific about the past few weeks, contact Detective Morrison."

As they walked back toward the parking lot, Morrison said quietly, "They don't like you."

"I noticed."

"It's not personal. You're FBI, you're federal authority, you're an outsider investigating something that makes them look incompetent. They're taking it as criticism."

"I don't care if they like me. I care if they're withholding information."

"They're not. They're just pissed off and defensive. Small-town attitude." Morrison checked his watch. "It's after five. Let's try the Anchor Tavern. That's where the old-timers hang out. They might be more talkative after a few beers."

---

The Anchor Tavern occupied a corner lot with windows that faced both Highway 101 and the harbor channel. It was a working bar, not a tourist attraction—vinyl booths, a scarred wooden bar, fishing nets and buoys as decoration, and the smell of beer and fried food heavy in the air. A handful of men sat at the bar, all over fifty, all with the weathered faces of people who made their living from the sea.

Morrison walked in like he belonged there. Brennan followed, immediately aware of the looks she drew—curious, guarded, unwelcoming. She'd been in plenty of bars during her career, but this felt different. This felt like trespassing.

Morrison ordered two beers from the bartender, a heavyset woman with steel-gray hair. "Sue, these gentlemen giving you any trouble?"

"Same as always." Sue poured the beers with practiced efficiency. "Who's your friend?"

"Agent Brennan, FBI. She's helping with an investigation."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees. Several of the men at the bar turned away, suddenly very interested in their drinks. One old fisherman in a stained work jacket muttered something that might have been "goddamn feds."

Morrison carried the beers to a booth where they could see the room. Brennan took the seat facing the bar. "You do better with them than I do."

"I'm Oregon state police, born in Eugene, worked the coast for eight years. I'm one of them, or close enough. You're federal government from Virginia, investigating something that threatens their livelihood. They're going to close ranks."

"So how do we get them to talk?"

"We don't. I do. You drink your beer and let me handle this."

Brennan watched as Morrison walked back to the bar, leaning against it casually, ordering another beer, striking up conversation about fishing conditions and crab season. The men gradually warmed to him, or at least stopped actively avoiding him. She caught fragments of conversation—complaints about prices, stories about difficult catches, speculation about next year's quotas.

Then Morrison said something about the caves, and the conversation stalled.

An old man at the end of the bar, face like weathered driftwood, spoke into the silence. "Those caves ain't good places. Never have been."

"How so?" Morrison asked carefully.

"Bad history. Bad water. Bad luck. Smart people stay clear."

"What kind of bad history?"

The old man drank from his beer, considering. "Smugglers in the twenties. Murder-suicide in the forties. People disappear. Not all at once, not enough to make news. But over the years..." He shrugged. "This is a fishing town. We know the ocean. We know when something's natural and when something ain't."

"And the caves aren't natural?"

"The caves are fine. It's what they attract that ain't natural."

Another fisherman down the bar spoke up. "Pete's talking folklore, Morrison. Don't take it serious. People drown because they're careless, not because caves are cursed."

"I didn't say cursed," Pete replied. "I said bad luck. There's a difference."

Morrison pressed gently. "Have you noticed anything unusual lately? Anyone hanging around the caves who shouldn't be?"

The fishermen exchanged glances. Finally Pete said, "You should ask Leonard Pruitt about the caves. Man knows them better than anyone. Obsessed with them, you ask me."

"Pruitt's a good man," Sue called from behind the bar. "Saved half your lives at one point or another with his rescue work."

"Didn't say he wasn't good," Pete muttered. "Just said he knows the caves."

Morrison left money on the bar and returned to the booth. "Let's go."

Outside, in the parking lot with the sound of the ocean constant in the background, Brennan asked, "Leonard Pruitt?"

"Name keeps coming up. Maritime rescue volunteer, lifetime local, cave expert. I know him by reputation—good guy, does a lot of community work. But apparently he's got a thing about caves."

"A thing?"

"That's the second time someone's mentioned he's obsessed with them." Morrison unlocked the pickup. "We need to pull his records, see where he was when the victims died, talk to him directly."

"Carefully," Brennan added. "If he's our killer and he knows we're looking at him—"

"He'll either run or escalate. Yeah." Morrison started the engine. "But we can't not interview him. His name is on too many lists."

As they pulled out of the parking lot, Brennan saw Pete standing in the tavern doorway, watching them leave. There was something in his expression—not hostility, not exactly concern. Warning, maybe. The look of someone who'd said more than was comfortable and less than he knew.

The evening sun was painting the ocean copper and gold. Somewhere in Depoe Bay, Leonard Pruitt was going about his evening. Fishing, maybe. Volunteering. Being a respected community member.

Or thinking about caves and tides and the seasonal workers who'd be here for another month of summer.

Brennan made notes as Morrison drove. The name Leonard Pruitt appeared three times now in their investigation—from the seasonal workers, from Tommy Vickers, from the old fishermen. That wasn't coincidence.

That was pattern.

And pattern was how you caught serial killers.
